Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much\nabout Fresleven's remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I\ncouldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to\nmeet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough\nto hide his bones. They were all there.

They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against\neach other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about\nthat station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as\neverything else—as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern, as\ntheir talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real\nfeeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory\nwas to be had, so that they could earn percentages.

It was a distinct glimpse: the dug-out,\nfour paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly\non the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home—perhaps; setting\nhis face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and\ndesolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply\na fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His name, you\nunderstand, had not been pronounced once. He was 'that man.' The\nhalf-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult\ntrip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as 'that\nscoundrel.' The 'scoundrel' had reported that the 'man' had been very\nill—had recovered imperfectly. . . . The two below me moved away then a\nfew paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance.

They approached again,\njust as the manager was saying, 'No one, as far as I know, unless a\nspecies of wandering trader—a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from\nthe natives.' Who was it they were talking about now? I gathered in\nsnatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and\nof whom the manager did not approve. 'We will not be free from unfair\ncompetition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,'\nhe said. 'Certainly,' grunted the other; 'get him hanged! Why not?\nAnything—anything can be done in this country. That's what I say;\nnobody here, you understand, <em>here</em>, can endanger your position. And\nwhy?

'And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk,' continued the other;\n'he bothered me enough when he was here. \"Each station should be like a\nbeacon on the road towards better things, a center for trade of course,\nbut also for humanizing, improving, instructing.\" Conceive you—that\nass! And he wants to be manager! No, it's—' Here he got choked by\nexcessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was\nsurprised to see how near they were—right under me. I could have spat\nupon their hats. They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought.\nThe manager was switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious\nrelative lifted his head. 'You have been well since you came out this\ntime?' he asked. The other gave a start. 'Who? I? Oh! Like a charm—like\na charm. But the rest—oh, my goodness! All sick.

We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic\nstyle. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far,\neither. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and\nflapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could\nsee a white man had lived there not very long ago. There remained a rude\ntable—a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner,\nand by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the\npages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the\nback had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which\nlooked clean yet.

Its title was, 'An\nInquiry into some Points of Seamanship,' by a man Tower, Towson—some\nsuch name—Master in his Majesty's Navy. The matter looked dreary\nreading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of\nfigures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing\nantiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve\nin my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the\nbreaking strain of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not\na very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a\nsingleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going\nto work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,\nluminous with another than a professional light.

The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had\nset. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on\nthe banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every\nliving bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone,\neven to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep—it\nseemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any\nkind could be heard.

We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees,\nof the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun\nhanging over it—all perfectly still—and then the white shutter came\ndown again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves.

Two others remained\nopen-mouthed a whole minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush\nout incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at\n'ready' in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we\nwere on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of\ndissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around\nher—and that was all.

I said, just for good fellowship's sake. 'Catch 'im,' he snapped,\nwith a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth—'catch\n'im. Give 'im to us.' 'To you, eh?'

It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really\na case of legitimate self-defense. You can't breathe dead hippo waking,\nsleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on\nexistence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of\nbrass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to\nbuy their provisions with that currency in river-side villages. You can\nsee how <em>that</em> worked. There were either no villages, or the people</p>",

Was it\nsuperstition, disgust, patience, fear—or some kind of primitive honor?\nNo fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust\nsimply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs,\nand what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.\nDon't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating\ntorment, its black thoughts, its somber and brooding ferocity? Well,\nI do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly.\nIt's really easier to face bereavement, dishonor, and the perdition of\none's soul—than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these\nchaps too had no earthly reason for</p>",

It was the only thing of the kind; but as we\nopened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sandbank,\nor rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of\nthe river.

We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by\nJove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter\non the land side.

I glanced over my shoulder, and the\npilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the\nwheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter\nopen and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening,\nglaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the\nsudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I\nhad wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded\nsmoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the\nbank—right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs\nand flying leaves.

The\nside of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared\na long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool.

And he had written it too.\nI've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence,\nbut too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had\nfound time for!

My friends the wood-cutters were likewise\nscandalized, and with a better show of reason—though I admit that the\nreason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite!

He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was\ndead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause\nsome startling trouble.

The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that\nat least this poor Kurtz had been properly revenged. 'Say! We must have\nmade a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh? What do you think?\nSay?' He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar.\nAnd he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help\nsaying, 'You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.' I had seen, from the\nway the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots\nhad gone too high. You can't hit anything unless you take aim and fire\nfrom the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes\nshut. The retreat, I maintained—and I was right—was caused by the\nscreeching of the steam-whistle. Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began\nto howl at me</p>",

'But he had no\ngoods to trade with by that time,' I objected. 'There's a good lot of\ncartridges left even yet,' he answered, looking away. 'To speak plainly,\nhe raided the country,' I said. He nodded. 'Not alone, surely!' He\nmuttered something about the villages round that lake. 'Kurtz got the\ntribe to follow him, did he?' I suggested. He fidgeted a little. 'They\nadored him,' he said. The tone of these words was so extraordinary that\nI looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his mingled eagerness\nand reluctance to speak of Kurtz.

And he would say yes, and then\nhe would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks;\nforget himself amongst these people—forget himself—you know.' 'Why!\nhe's mad,' I said. He protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn't be mad.\nIf I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at\nsuch a thing. . . . I had taken up my binoculars while we talked and was\nlooking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and\nat the back of the house.

The\nRussian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had\ncome down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of\nthat lake tribe. He had been absent for several months—getting himself\nadored, I suppose—and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention to\nall appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream.\nEvidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of the—what\nshall I say?—less material aspirations.

And then I made a brusque movement,\nand one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the\nfield of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck at the\ndistance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the\nruinous aspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its\nfirst result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow.

Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I\ncan't say. I think the knowledge came to him at last—only at the very\nlast. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a\nterrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered\nto him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he\nhad no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude—and the\nwhisper had proved irresistibly fascinating.

'Perfectly,' he answered, raising his voice\nfor that single word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail\nthrough a speaking-trumpet. 'If he makes a row we are lost,' I thought\nto myself.

'There was the making of an immense\nsuccess,' said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank gray\nhair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to doubt\nhis statement; and to this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz's\nprofession, whether he ever had any—which was the greatest of his\ntalents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else\nfor a journalist who could paint—but even the cousin (who took snuff\nduring the interview) could not tell me what he had been—exactly. He\nwas a universal genius—on that point I agreed with the old chap, who\nthereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and\nwithdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and\nmemoranda without importance.

He electrified large meetings. He had\nfaith—don't you see?—he had the faith. He could get himself to believe\nanything—anything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme\nparty.'

Did I know, he\nasked, with a sudden flash of curiosity, 'what it was that had induced\nhim to go out there?' 'Yes,' said I, and forthwith handed him the\nfamous Report for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced through it\nhurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged 'it would do,' and took himself\noff with this plunder.</p>",

Yes; and also some other feeling\nperhaps. All that had been Kurtz's had passed out of my hands: his soul,\nhis body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career.
